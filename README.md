## Name-Based Gender Classification Project

This project aims to predict the gender associated with a given name using machine learning techniques. It includes implementations using Support Vector Machines (SVM), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and demonstrates the process with datasets containing both global and Indian names.

### Features:

- **Support Vector Machines (SVM) Implementation:**
  - Utilizes the linear kernel of SVM for binary classification.
  - Features CountVectorizer for converting names into numerical features.
  - Achieves classification accuracy and provides detailed classification reports.

- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) Implementation:**
  - Employs LSTM architecture for sequential data processing.
  - Incorporates tokenization and padding of name sequences.
  - Evaluates model accuracy and performance with classification reports.

### Dataset:

- The project includes datasets containing names and corresponding genders, sourced from both global and Indian demographics.

### Technologies Used:

- **Python Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, nltk
- **Machine Learning Models:** Support Vector Machines, Recurrent Neural Networks
- **Data Preprocessing:** Tokenization, Padding, Label Encoding

### How to Use:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the required Python libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
- Choose the desired implementation (SVM or RNN) and dataset.
- Execute the provided scripts for training, testing, and predicting gender based on input names.
- Experiment with different hyperparameters or datasets for further exploration.
